# Using Machine Learning to Differentiate Cammeo and Osmancik Varieties

Among  the certified rice grown in TURKEY,  the  Osmancik species, which has a large planting area since 1997 and the Cammeo species grown since 2014 have been selected for the study.  When  looking  at  the  general  characteristics  of  Osmancik species, they have a wide, long, glassy and dull appearance.  When looking at the general characteristics of the Cammeo species, they have wide and long, glassy and dull in appearance.  A total of 3810 rice grain's images were taken for the two species, processed and feature inferences were made. 7 morphological features were obtained for each grain of rice.
